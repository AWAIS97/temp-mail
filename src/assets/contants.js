    title: "The difference between a regular mailbox and TEMP MAIL",
    image: img2,
    description: `
    <div>     
<p>Everyone out there on the internet has their own personal email address. It is now a necessary part of life in the modern world. However, most people do not open their personal email addresses every day. I myself don't login into my personal email for weeks at a time, as I don’t have to. But most other services on the internet require an email address to sign up and log in. Any subscription-based service, a site that is linked to your financials, or social media platforms requires an email to login and register. So it is important that you have a personal email address.</p><br><br>
<p>But when you sign up for all these different services, your personal email mailbox eventually becomes clogged with all of the unopened emails you never got around to reading. Some people have email mailboxes that are so clogged and organized that they would rather create a brand-new personal email than sort through their current mailbox! At first, I thought that creating a new email was lazy and ridiculous, but after trying to sort through my own congested mailbox, I now understand the appeal!</p><br><br>
<p>However, not every service needs to be linked to a permanent email address. Some services, apps, and websites will only ask for your email address in the beginning when you register and then never ask for it again. So, it may be handy for you to use temporary email services when you sign up for these platforms. There are few differences when it comes to the mailboxes of permanent email addresses and temporary ones, but each has its own benefits.</p><br><br>
<h3>Why use a temporary email service? You don’t have to hassle with organizing it!</h3>
<p>One of the biggest differences between a regular personal email and a temporary mail is that you don't have to worry about organizing the temporary email mailbox. Since you will only use it for a finite amount of time, there's no need to filter through the spam and delete old emails. In less than a week, your temporary email will be gone and you won’t have to spend hours searching through hundreds of emails to find the one that you want.</p><br><br>
<p>And the best part is that if you ever do need to keep an email but it is in your temporary email accounts, just forward it to your personal email! That's all you need to do!</p><br><br>
<h3>Multiple addresses, one mailbox</h3>
<p>When you use a temporary email service, another big difference is that you can have multiple email addresses but only one mailbox. There are plenty of temporary email services that allow their customers to create multiple emails and then have it all connected to one mailbox. When you use a permanent personal email, you only have one mailbox. If you would like a second email to be connected to your mailbox, you have to create a brand new email and then forward all of the emails from the second account over to the first account. That's a lot of work! A temporary email address service does this for you automatically.</p><br><br>
<p>The two characteristics above are the two major differences between a regular email mailbox and a temporary email mailbox. As you can see, temporary emails are permanent but they are more flexible</p></div>

<p>Protecting your email is so important in this day and age. No matter what type of email you have, you should be very wary of who you give your email address. When internet security and safety guides inform their readers about protecting their email, they usually mean protecting it from dangerous entities that are on the internet. Phishing scammers exist on every part of the internet, and their constant success means that they aren't going anywhere.</p><br><br>
<p>If a phishing scammer gets a hold of your email, they will send you as many messages as it takes to finally trick you. Phishing scammers are relentless, and they don't care about anyone else but themselves.</p><br><br>
<p>Another major issue for everyone who has an email account is spam. Once you start receiving spam, there is no way to stop it. Spam, like a phishing scammer, is relentless. It will never stop coming, and you will never be safe from it again. Depending on the type of email platform you use, all of the spam you receive will either end up in the spam email box or infect your main inbox, and you have to sort through it manually to remove it.</p><br><br>
<p>While these are the two biggest issues involving email, they certainly are not the only issues. Different threats exist in this world, and not all of them are on the internet.</p><br><br>
<p>Sometimes, the threat to our email does not come from the internet that comes from the person standing right behind us.</p><br><br>
<p>Whether we are at work, using a computer at the library, or in the comfort of our home, sometimes the threat to our internet safety is the human being that we say hi to every day. If the threat is at your work, it is most likely your manager or your manager's favorite employee. Managers hate it when employees use work time to check personal email.</p><br><br>
<p>If the threat is in your home, it is likely your parents or your partner who clearly doesn't understand boundaries.</p><br><br>
<p>If you suspect other people are watching you, do not open your personal email, no matter how badly you need to send an email. Since you now know that people are watching you, it's best to give them as little information as possible. If they do not know which email platform you use, do not give them that information.</p><br><br>
<p>To protect yourself and your personal email account, you should use a temporary email service if you need to send an email to anyone.</p><br><br>
<p>Using a temporary email is the best tactic to use if you are being watched. Remember that managers can ask the IT department to pull up activity records of any employee they want. So you do not want your manager to know that you have been visiting your personal email account.</p><br><br>
<p>But there is one more upside to using a temporary email account. If you use a different temporary email every time you send an email to someone watching you, they will try to figure out which one of the temporary emails is your permanent email account.</p><br><br>
<p>Remember, if anyone is watching you, protect yourself and your personal information as best you can.</p></div>

    title: "How to Prank a Friend Using the TEMP MAIL Service",

    <div>     
<p>Life has a strange way of putting an idea into our heads. There will be some days where we wake up in the morning, drink a giant cup of coffee, inhale a breath of fresh cool air as we walk outside, and then decide to prank our best friend this week. As long as you pick the right type of prank that matches well with your target's personality and the prank is not malicious in any way, most people do enjoy a good prank. Once they discover that they are being pranked, shock turns to slight embarrassment and laughter as realization dawns on them.</p><br><br>
<p>Yes, a good-natured funny prank is worth its weight in gold.&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<p>But what type of prank should you do? Well, one great tool to use for someone is to use a temporary email service. By using a temporary email service, you can be sneaky and send them all kinds of messages and send them down a rabbit hole.&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<p>Just make sure you don't use your type of writing you say when you're writing. You need to change your grammar and writing style so that the person you are pranking does not figure out it is you.</p><br><br>
<p>The mysterious package prank</p>
<p>One type of hilarious prank is the mysterious package prank. Here's how to do it:&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<p>First, by 20 or more of a simple item. You can buy rubber duckies, erasers, popsicles, etc. Just buy something that you know will absolutely confuse your target and then buy a lot of it.&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<p>Second, create a temporary email and make the email sound like a business email.</p><br><br>
<p>Third, email your target and tell them that their package is now en route to their house. Two things will happen. They will either send you an email to ask what they bought or, because of the high amounts of spam that is now in everybody's inbox, they will simply ignore the email because they believe it is spam.</p><br><br>
<p>Fourth, send them an email every 3 to 4 hours updating them on the status of their package. If you can, schedule some emails to be sent to your target while asleep and at work.</p><br><br>
<p>If they ever write an email back to you to reject the package, just say that the purchase is not refundable and the payment has already been received. That will have them looking through their purchase records to find a shipment they did not know about.</p><br><br>
<p>If you can, try to make a box look like a real package. If you have the money and the patience, purchase your prank gift from eBay and send it directly to your friend's house. Just make sure all of their information is on the order form, not yours! Or else the prank will be over.</p><br><br>
<p>Continue sending your target packages containing small items for the next few months and watch as they go nuts trying to have the packages stopped and as they look for charges on their credit cards or Paypal. Send about six packages in total and make sure each one is something cheap and silly.&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<p>The last email you send your target should be a picture of yourself and all of the package orders.&nbsp;</p><br><br>
<p>And that's how you do the mysterious package prank!</p></div>

    title: "Are you annoyed by SPAM? Use temporary email addresses.",

    <div>     

<p>The most annoying, disrespectful, and downright ridiculous issue that most human beings have to deal with is the mosquito in the real world. This ugly, tiny, invasive, disgusting pest spreads disease to any areas that it reaches and provides no benefit other than feeding frogs. Mankind has been fighting mosquitoes and the destruction that they bring for thousands of years, and it looks like we will be fighting mosquitoes for a few hundred more.</p><br><br>
<p>Another pest exists that is just as annoying, useless, and invasive as the mosquito on the internet. And this enemy is just as undefeatable. It is called spam email.</p><br><br>
<p>Spam email is so prevalent in our society now that most people expect to get it. There are multiple jokes across countless TV shows and movies about spam email.</p><br><br>
<p>Spam email is more common than mosquitos since everyone in the world with an email account has received spam at least once in their life.</p><br><br>
<p>I would go as far as to say that spam email is worse than mosquitoes because once you receive a single piece of spam email into your inbox, your fate is sealed. You are now vulnerable to receiving spam email for the rest of your life as long as you have that email account.</p><br><br>
<p>So is there a way to minimize the amount of spam email in your inbox? Is there a way to stop it completely?</p><br><br>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to completely prevent yourself from receiving spam emails. Everyone eventually gets at least one spam email, and once they start arriving in your inbox, there's no way to completely stop them. The only thing a person can do is take extreme caution and follow preventative measures.</p><br><br>
<p>Once your email gets on a spam email list, you will always receive spam, as there is no way to take yourself off of the spam email list. But if you follow a few rules and protect your email as much as possible, you can have a very clean inbox in a very small spam folder.</p><br><br>
<p>So here's how you can protect yourself and your email account.</p><br><br>
<p>The first rule to protecting yourself is to scrutinize every single website that requires your email address.</p><br><br>
<p>You could only give your email out to official institutions like online banking, investing accounts, Your Entertainment accounts like Hulu, Netflix, Steam, Microsoft Game Pass, and your bills like the electricity, car insurance, Etc. These services never give their customer's email addresses out to spammers. If they do, the government will crack down on them and charge them millions of dollars worth of fines.</p><br><br>
<p>To protect yourself and your email account, use a temporary email address when you need to sign up for an account for an app or website that is not any of the types of sites mentioned above. So if you want to create an account for Flickr, deviantART, Instagram, We suggest that you do not give these types of websites and apps your email. If a website isn't linked to your credit card account, it doesn't need your email.</p></div>

      "What is Phishing and How to Protect Yourself Using the TEMP MAIL Service",
    image: img6,
    description: `
<div>
<p>Every year, millions of people fall victim to phishing scams and end up losing tens of millions of dollars a year to scammers. A phishing scam is a scam where scammers send fake emails or phone calls and try to trick the target into giving them their personal information. One of the biggest reasons why so many people are still falling for scams is how sophisticated phishing scammers make their scams. Some scammers even go as far as having a dedicated phone line to pretend to be the customer service of a bank or credit card.</p><br><br>
<p>Whenever you hear of someone becoming a target or a victim of a phishing scam, it is often believed that that person is elderly or they are someone who does not know English very well. But anyone can be the victim of a phishing scam.</p><br><br>
<p>Becoming the victim of a phishing scam can ruin your life and erase the last five years of your hard work. So here are a few important ways to protect yourself from phishing scams.</p><br><br>
<p><strong>Do not click on links that are in suspicious emails.</strong></p><br><br>
<p>Think about all of the online services that you enjoy. These Services could be entertainment, such as Hulu or Netflix, social media such as Instagram or LinkedIn, important online software such as Google Docs or Microsoft Office, and so on. Any website or service you use could be a potential method for phishing scammers to get ahold of your information.</p><br><br>
<p>Now, it is important to note that fishing scammers send out fake mass emails disguised as real emails from companies so they can get as many targets as possible. For example, let's say you receive an email from Netflix and it says that your personal account has been compromised or that it needs a new payment method. First of all, scammers don't know if the email they are sending these fake emails to is linked to a Netflix account. But many people use Netflix, so they are likely to get at least a hundred people who have a Netflix account if they send a fake email out to five thousand email addresses.</p><br><br>
<p>No matter what the email says, never click on any links from the email. If you think that your account could actually have this issue, then close your email and call the Netflix customer service line. Ask them if there are any issues with your account. This is the best way to protect yourself from phishing scammers.</p><br><br>
<p><strong>Do not give your personal email to anyone you don't trust.</strong></p><br><br>
<p>Using a temporary email whenever you sign up for a site you don't fully trust is a critical way to protect yourself. Many websites say that they never ever share their subscribers' personal information with any other website, but we know that is not true. When we put our email address out on the internet, we are sending it into a void we do not understand. So always use a temporary email when signing up to strange websites and only use your personal email when you trust the site completely.</p></div>
